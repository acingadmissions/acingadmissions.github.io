						<p>I graduated from MIT earlier this year and, in thinking back, this distant dream was made possible with Kim and Kavita’s skillful guidance through the application process five years ago, months before the first edition of <i>Acing Admissions</i> was released. With this new edition, you can access their wisdom through additional case studies and updated facts and figures. It really is a “must read” for students and parents alike. </p>

						<p>“Insightful yet simple,” is how I would descri be <i>Acing Admissions</i>. I chanced upon the first edition of this book three years ago when my daughter was thinking of applying to US colleges. <i>Acing Admissions</i></b> beautifully weaves various components of the application into a coherent whole. The sections on Choosing Colleges and Extracurricular activities deserve a special mention. For me, it will have been worth $270,000, the total amount of financial aid and merit scholarship s that my daughter will ultimately receive over her four years of college. </p>
						<p>As an SAT/ACT coach for students around the world, I have recommended the first edition of this book to 1000+ families over the last three years and have always received rave reviews. I am sure the second edition will exceed the huge expectations that the first one created. Miss it at your own risk!! </p>
